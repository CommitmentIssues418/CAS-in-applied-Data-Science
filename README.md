# CAS in Applied Data Science: Coursework and Documentation

This repository contains all course materials, exercises, notebooks, and project work completed during the **CAS in Applied Data Science** at the University of Bern from August 2025 to August 2026.  
Each module has its own folder, which includes scripts, data, documentation, and results.  
A separate folder contains the **Final CAS Project**.

The goal of this repository is to collect, structure, and document all work completed during the CAS in Applied Data Science.  
It provides a unified place for all modules, exercises, analyses, and the final project, ensuring clarity, continuity, and traceability across the entire program.
